      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey there, my name is Sailesh Badri, and I am a grade 10 MaCS student at William Lyon Mackenzie. I have always had a passion for math and coding, which has helped me grow as a programmer with experience in various areas of programming. One of my favourite things to do is participate in coding competitions, where I can put my skills to the test and challenge myself to find creative solutions to complex problems. I started my journey of programming by learning C++, and then I later learned Python which has become my go-to language for most projects due to its various use cases. My favourite colour is red and I am very picky about it in my daily life. I'm also a big soccer fan, and my favourite player is Lionel Messi. Soccer is one of my favourite sports to play as well, and I try to stay active by playing whenever I have the chance alongside badminton. I am currently a part of  the Athletic council, and am also a memeber in MCPT, Math club, MSC and Robotics club. I'm also a big fan of Hip Hop and rap, and I love listening to music whenever I'm feeling stressed or need to unwind. Thanks a lot for visiting my portfolio!</p>

      <h3>Graph Theory</h3>
      
      <p>
        One of the most interesting coding concepts I learned this year to get better at competitive programming was graph theory. This enabled me to model and solve complex problems efficiently. The main concept I learned in graph theory was BFS (breadth-first search) and DFS (depth-first search). These enabled me to solve problems relating to relationships, for example, to find the shortest path algorithm we could use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. Therefore, through learning the concept of graph theory, I was equipped with the knowledge to solve more complex algorithms.

      <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
      <p>
        I have always found Machine learning to be fascinating and this year I decided to learn basic machine learning programs using TensorFlow and understand the underlying concept of AI. I learned about the different steps to create an AI and I was fascinated by the amount of data required for it to work. One of the algorithms I learned that I used with facial detection was Haar Cascade. The concept of it is to basically use the most common patterns and keep looping through the different pixels of that image and see if the patterns match the image. If more than a certain amount of patterns match the specific spot of the image, then it is a face.

      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>
        I have always known basic HTML and CSS, however, I have especially started to learn more about web development to gain new programming skills. I created multiple websites that served different purposes, to test out my knowledge, and had a lot of fun doing so. I have recently started learning React and Flask to create more complex and structured websites. I am working towards making a website that could be published and used publically

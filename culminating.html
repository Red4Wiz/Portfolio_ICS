        <h1>Habitat Hero</h1>
        <div class="culm-content">
            <h3>Overview & Purpose</h3>
            <p>One of the largest issues in the world is homelessness and shelter insecurity. In African developing countries such as Ethiopia, there are over 150,000 street children, a million in Egypt, and over 250,000 in Kenya. More than 80 million African children lack access to healthy shelter, and 16 million of these children are living on the streets. Habitat Hero is designed to not only educate smaller children on shelter security, but also how to survive if they ever find themselves in that unfortunate situation. Teaching kids the basic knowledge required to build makeshift houses will have a huge impact on them and their families due to the need for homes. The game is kids friendly and contains very simple instructions to play. The aim of the game is to expose the importance to a healthy shelter, and give them the idea to create a makeshift shelter for themselves. The game also shows the difficulties and challenges people face in their everyday lives, and the children will slowly learn to adapt to them. The aim of the game is to help children realize the important effects of an healthy shelter and learn to rise above the challenges they face.</p>

        <div class="culm-content">
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The objective of the game is to always have a shelter at night by collecting materials and building throughout the day. If you don't have a shelter by the end of the night the game ends. Each night the shelter takes a random amount of damage that you have to fix the next day. The materials are also spawned at random so be careful with your selection as you can only pick up a certain amount of materials at a time.

            <p><strong>Learning Screen: </strong>This is the first level of game, and this screen aims to give the user an overview on the controls, objective and information on the importance of the game. This screen allows for user input, as the left and right arrow keys are used to switch between the instruction screens.

            <img src="assets/level2.png" alt="Level 2 Image" class="culm-image">
            <p><strong>Testing Screen: </strong>This is the second level of the game, and this screen tests the user on the knowledge that they learned from the learning screen. This level aims to make the user apply and test their skills to complete the main objective of building a house. User input is allowed in the form by clicking the 'WASD' keys for movement, the 'P' key to pick up items and 'B' to build the house. Mouse pressed is also allowed for the home button. Through completing the following level, the user has gained the necessary skills to play the actual game.</p>

        <div class="culm-level">
            <h4>Level 3</h4>
            <img src="assets/level3.png" alt="Level 3 Image" class="culm-image">
            <p><strong>Final Level Screen: </strong>This is the last level of the game and allows full freedom for the user to play the game. The user is required to collect materials every day to build their house, to survive the upcoming night. The controls for movement and actions are the same as testing, however, new control is added for the screen for building the house. Mouse click is required to add or subtract the materials you want to add to the building, and then the build button should be pressed to add to the house. The house takes increasing damage every night, and the user has to try to survive as long as possible. This level emphasizes the importance of shelter insecurity, and how the user should continue to never give up and try as hard as they can.</p>

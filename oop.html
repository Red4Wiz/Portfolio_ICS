        <h1>OOP Introduction</h1>
        <p>Object-Oriented programming (OOP) is a way to simulate real-life situations through software. Rather than functions and logic involved in a typical program, OOP is a way to use coding to design data using objects. For example, imagine a car, we can use OOP to simulate a car object in code with its own attributes (features), and methods (functions). .</p>

        <h1>OOP Information</h1>
        <p>There are two main structures when using OOP, which are objects and classes. A Class is a template that contains the variables and the methods common to a specific type of object, such as a Car class. An object however is an instance of a class that holds specific values such as its name, attribute and behaviour, such as the Mustang object. These objects hold their own unique attributes and methods unless it is static which means its common to all cars, and that is an access identifier. Private means the attribute/method cant be accessed outside the class and public means it can be accessed outside the class, which are some other access identifiers. Protected is also an access modifier and can be used when you want to access in subclasses, this is an inheritance which will be talked about later. It is good practice to use get/set methods instead of accessing attributes directly so the original data can’t be corrupted/changed as easily. Constructor is a standard part of a class that has the same name as the class and when an object is created it is automatically run when a constructor is not created, a default constructor is made by Java but this is not good practice. The new operator is used with the constructor to create the object.</p>

        <h1>Inheritance</h1>
        <p>Inheritance is a very important and useful feature that can be used with classes to create more realistic situations. Inheritance is when you create a subclass that inherits all the properties from a main class, therefore there is no need to rewrite code. Just like how a child inherits their features from their parents but still has their own features that are unique to them. Overriding is when you create a method in the subclass that is the same as the parent class and in this case, the subclass runs the method inside this than the main class which is overriding its main class method. This is especially useful in scenarios where two subclasses have things in common. Encapsulation is hiding specific attributes so they can’t be accessed elsewhere. Abstraction is the process of identifying a general-purpose class that contains common properties and methods that you want to use as the parent class for a number of related classes. “this” is an important keyword in OOP. It is mainly used in cases of inheritance when mentioning the instance object itself.</p>

        <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
        <p>
          In Java polymorphism is the ability of a class to to use different implementations of a method depending on the type of object it is. This allows us to perform the same action in many different ways, therefore this only occurs when inheritance is involved. Superclasses of different subclasses are all polymorphic, or another way of thinking about this is that if a class can pass more than one IS-A test, it is polymorphic. The two different types of polymorphism is the runtime polymorphism and compile time polymorphism. It’s ok if you don’t understand this yet, we will go over some code examples.

          You can perform polymorphism in Java in two different ways through either Method overloading or Method overriding. Method overloading is the process of creating multiple methods of the same name in the same class, but having different set of parameters. This allows the method to work in different ways. Method overriding is the process of rewriting a method in the subclass however it contains a different function. Here are example codes to demonstrate both overriding and overloading.

          Compile Time Polymorphism is when the call to the method is resolved at compile-time. This is achieved through Method Overloading. Therefore at compile time it uses the method according to the parameters passed.

          Runtime polymorphism in Java is the process when the call to an overridden method is resolved dynamically at runtime rather than at compile-time. This can be achieved through Method Overriding. Therefore instead of using the method of the parent class, this uses the method created within the object subclass it was instantiated as.
